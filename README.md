# ScratchOS Development
We are [a bunch of Scratchers](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/410607312/) who are working to make the best OS.

# ScratchOS features
We plan to include great features like cloud data saving in ScratchOS.

# When will it be released? 
We plan to release the first public stable version of ScratchOS by February 2021. However, you can experience it early, by using the beta version which we plan to release by September 2020. You will be able to use both versions as a native Scratch project, or download either the .sb3 file or desktop app.
